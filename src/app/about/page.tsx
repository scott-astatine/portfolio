            Hi, I’m Scott—self-taught machine learning enthusiast, part-time sci-fi
            philosopher, and full-time bug whisperer. If you've ever screamed at
            your Jupyter notebook only for it to magically start working after you
            threaten it with deletion, <i>we're already friends</i>.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6">
            After graduating high school in 2024, I decided to skip the traditional
            college route (for now) and commit myself to an intense 10-month journey
            into Data Science and Machine Learning. Why wait four years to build
            things when I can start now? I’m currently learning everything from the
            ground up—Python, statistics, machine learning algorithms, and all those
            weird quirks of Pandas that make you question reality.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6">
            I’m deeply interested in how data can be used to solve real problems—
            whether that’s predicting heart failure from clinical records, automating
            decision-making, or understanding complex systems at scale. I like my
            models interpretable, my code clean-ish, and my debug logs... well, at
            least not screaming in red. While most people fear AI taking over the
            world, I’m the type who’s like, “Cool, but can it clean my room?”
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6">
            Jokes aside, I believe machine learning, especially in areas like biotech
            and medicine, can radically transform lives—and I want to be part of that
            wave. I’m particularly fascinated by the intersection of ML,
            bioinformatics, and computational biology, and I’d love to eventually
            work on algorithms that help us understand the biology of aging,
            disease, and everything in between.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6">
            When I’m not wrangling data or chasing down bugs like they owe me money,
            I’m watching sci-fi shows, daydreaming about sentient robots, or plotting
            how to someday build an AI sidekick that's more "Jarvis" and less
            "Clippy." I bring curiosity, grit, and a decent sense of humor to every
            project I touch. Whether it’s classification, regression, or just
            figuring out why my model thinks every flower is a tulip—I’m always up
            for the challenge.
